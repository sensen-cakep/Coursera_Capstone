This is due to the appeal of lifetime ink that comes with the printer, tackling the perennial issue of frequent purchases of costly ink supplies.\n\nEpson is the market leader currently with HP catching up hard to gain market share. With limited go to market funds and retail costs, **how can HP effectively compete in different countries by being selective in the in-country choice of cities to promote their printers with targeted product placement?**\n\nFor this project data science will be used to answer the above question. This will be a valuable tool for HP to gain market share rapidly without eroding profits unnecessarily to achieve it.\n\n**India will be the chosen country** as it is one of the main battlegrounds of the ink tank printer war."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
